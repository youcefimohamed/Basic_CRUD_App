# Basic_CRUD_App


The "Basic CRUD App using React" project is a simple application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with React, using JSON Server as a simulated backend. Users can create, view, update, and delete items through a user-friendly interface. JSON Server is used to simulate a RESTful server and provide the necessary CRUD functionality for the application.

The code of the application is organized into reusable components and follows best practices for React development. Data is stored in a JSON file and managed by JSON Server. This allows for testing and development of the application locally without the need for a real backend.

Contributions on GitHub are welcome to enhance the application, add new features, or optimize the existing code. Join this project to develop your React skills, collaborate with other developers, and create a functional CRUD application using JSON Server as a simulated backend.
